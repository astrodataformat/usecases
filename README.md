# Overview

This repository is for discussion of Use Cases relating to the future
of astronomy data formats.

This document describes the approach of the astrodataformat group
toward creating a whitepaper which describes the requirements on modern
astronomical data formats.

We will have a structured process (described below) and utilize 2 sites
to enable the work. All discussion is to be held on the astrodataformat
Google group and all of the documents are kept on the astrodataformat
repository. These sites may respectively be found at:

1. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astrodataformat
2. https://github.com/astrodataformat


# Member requirements

Members will need to belong to the astrodataformat group. The group is
open to any member of the astronomy community who wishes to participate.
Along with belonging to this group, members are required, at minimum,
to read the draft whitepaper to be submitted for publication and pass
along any comments they may have. IF they agree to the content, then they
will be added as co-authors on the draft.

Members are further encouraged to contribute use cases, extract requirements
and provide wording for the draft. In this case, because we plan to
utilize GitHub to hold these documents, members will need to obtain a GitHub
account (see https://github.com/ for instructions on obtaining a free account).
After the GitHub account is obtained, either Tim or Brian can then add the
member to the astrodataformat organization which will allow them permission
to edit.


# Project Structure

The project is broken up into several phases. Passage through these
phases is roughly linear, but we may revisit a prior phase in order
to capture missed information/correct errors/issues.

## Capture Use Cases

Member of the group will submit their use cases. There is no level of
generality required. Use case scope may be set to any level of usage. Members
should indicate ownership and work with other members to resolve commonalities,
discrepancies and other issues in use cases.

## Extraction of requirements

Requirements will be extracted from use cases. The group will periodically
reflect on whether the corpus of requirements have sufficient size and
scope.

## Ranking of Requirements

After compiling a list of requirements, and agreeing that the corpus is of
sufficient size and scope, Members will be requested to vote on
the contributed requirements. A simple value of 1, 0 or -1 shall be permitted
for each member to attach to each requirement. After a sufficient number
of members have voted, the survey will be tallied and the lowest 20% of requirements
dropped. The group will be then polled with each member voting on whether
the remaining corpus is of sufficient size, too large or too small. If
it is either too big or small the threshold will be adjusted and another
vote taken to determine if it is of sufficient size. Once it is agreed that
the corpus is sufficient, then the corpus will be the requirements which will
go into the white paper.

## Write white paper

A white paper using the agreed corpus of requirements will be created. Members
are encouraged to help contribute content and review drafts. When members
are agreed that the paper is of sufficient quality, it will be submitted for
publication to the A&C journal.

# Ground Rules

A few important ground rules for discussion

1. Please refrain from criticism of the relevance of the use cases others contribute.
It is fair to question clarity, completeness and meaning. Remember you will be
allowed to vote on relevance in the ranking stage and can vote down any requirements
you feel are edge cases or irrelevant for most astronomers.

2. No discussion of implementation or design of a new astronomical data format
is allowed. Its OK to utilize existing or imagined data formats to help illustrate
use cases.
